## Description 

The README generator is a command-line application that generates a professionally formatted README file from user input using the Inquirer package. This cuts out some of the time it would take for someone to have to fully structure a README file, so that they can focus on the more involved parts of the project. To use the app, you must first clone the repo into whatever directory you want to use. Then you need to run a few commands in the terminal.

    npm init -y
    npm i inquirer@8.2.4
    node index.js

Then you will be prompted to enter information pertaining to your project which will be added to the README when it is generated. A new folder called "output" should show up in the file path and in there will be the generated README.md file. There is a sample generated README using the app in the "Sample" folder.
